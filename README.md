CapSavvinator
=============

CapSavvinator is a website (based on CapSavvy) that can retrieve your data transfer usage from most independent ISPs and displays it in your web browser

(Actually it only supports Start right now, since I need Usernames / API Keys for the other providers before I can port and test the code from CapSavvy)
